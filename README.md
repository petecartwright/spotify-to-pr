# spotify-to-pr

Simple Chrome extension to put what you're listening to on Spotify into your GitHub PR description.

Maybe you want to remember what you were listening to when you come back to debug. Maybe you want to enhance the general vibes of a PR. Maybe you want to impress your coworkers with your deep cuts. Maybe you just like the little pictures?
